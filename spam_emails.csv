don ' t wait for customized drugs , which are years away . buy shares in a company using dna for diagnostic work .  forbes - good genes , kerry a . dolan , may 16 , 2005  new patented tests created with information gleaned from genome mapping have injected new life and higher margins ( near 75 % ) into the business . the $ 2 . 5 billion molecular diagnostics industry is expanding at a 15 % annual rate , according to consulting firm leomics associates of emerson , n . j .  genethera ( gtha ) : making their mark in biotech  genethera has just recently teamed up with biotech giant beckman coulter inc .  they are the first to market with a blood test for mad cow disease on live cattle  they have the ability to detect numerous infectious diseases utilizing genetic methods from the blood of a live animal  they are the first to market with a blood test for detecting cwd  they are presently developing a therapeutic vaccine for cwd and mad cow disease using rna interference technology  they are currently developing a blood test using the same platform for breast and prostate cancer detection with their strategic partner xpng ( xpention genetics inc . )  genethera could end beef recalls ' and potentially the slaughter of millions of animals around the globe while saving the industry hundreds of millions of dollars each year  currently funded by an institutional money manager in southern california , genethera has plans to open laboratories worldwide to handle this growing bse testing demand .  genethera could generate revenues over $ 13 million for every 1 % of cattle tested in the usa alone  international testing figures would be staggering .  genethera technology :  genethera ' s business is based on its integrated technology platform ( itp ) that combines a proprietary diagnostic solution called gene expression assay ( gea ( tm ) ) with purivax ( tm ) , its system for analyzing large - scale dna sequencing .  the first part of this platform is the ongoing development of molecular diagnostic assays solutions using real time fluorogenic polymerase chain reaction ( f - pcr ) technology to detect the presence of infectious disease from the blood of live animals . the second part of the itp is the development of therapeutic vaccines using rna interference technology . it also allows for the efficient , effective , and continuous testing , management and treatment of animal populations . these facts distinguish the technology from any alternative testing and management methodology available to agriculture today - - all of which require the destruction of individual animals and even entire herds . our testing and data analysis processes also allow us not only to separate infected from clean animals , but also to gain knowledge vital to development of preventative vaccines .  genethera inc . is committed to providing global access to cutting edge biotechnology services to fellow scientists in academia , the pharmaceutical industry , and the biotechnology industry . primarily , genethera ' s expertise focuses on technology relevant to animal and human immunotherapy . genethera is dedicated to furnishing dependable , high quality , cost - effective and prompt client consulting services . these services are backed by the cumulative experiences of greater than 100 years of research and development in both government and industry by genethera ' s senior scientists . genethera develops a commercial - scale implementation of adenovector purification process to support rd material production . furthermore , genethera evaluates and tests commercially available expression vectors and incorporates them into its vector repertoire . these technologies are well established within the repertoire of genethera ' s scientific staff .  genethera can uniquely detect and treat a variety of diseases in animals while they are still alive .  the company provides genetics - based diagnostic and vaccine solutions to meet the growing demands of today ' s veterinary industry and tomorrow ' s agriculture and healthcare industries . the company is organized and operated both to continually apply its scientific research to more effective management of diseases and , in so doing , realize the commercial potential of molecular biotechnology .  the core of genethera ' s operation is the ongoing development of molecular diagnostic assays using real time fluorogenic polymerase chain reaction . ( f - pcr ) technology uses live animal blood to detect the presence of infectious diseases and for the development of vaccines for such blood born diseases . it also allows for the efficient , effective , and continuous testing , management and treatment of animal populations . these facts distinguish the technology from any alternative testing and management methodology available to agriculture today - - all of which require the destruction of individual animals and even entire herds . our testing and data analysis processes also allow us not only to separate infected from clean animals , but also to gain knowledge vital to development of preventative vaccines .  to date , genethera has successfully developed the assay ability to detect mad cow and chronic wasting disease , a disease affecting elk and deer in north america . diagnostic assays for e . coli ol 57 : h 7 and johnne ' s disease are in the final stages of development . vaccines for e . coli ol 57 : h 7 and johnne ' s disease , both of which are diseases affecting cattle , are in advanced stages of development . in the future , the company plans to expand assay application research to a wide range of diseases / animals , the immediate targets being mad cow , hoof mouth , west nile and newcastle .  genethera can detect bse using the companies patented live animal blood test that evaluates the e . d . r . f . gene sequence . the e . d . r . f . gene is proven to decrease dramatically before any tse infection is noticeable in a live animal or human . the patent gtha holds is broad based and can detect all tse diseases including mad cow ( bse ) in cattle , cwd in elk deer and creutzfeld - jacobs in humans  the company ' s patented test can detect these diseases faster than any other method developed in the marketplace and at far less a cost . the test can also be used on a mass scale using roche f - pcr , dna analyzing robotics equipment . genethera can analyze over 2000 blood samples a day with one f - pcr machine and a single technician . the project will prove highly profitable at approx $ 4 . 00 per test when wide scale commercialization is under way .  a multi - billion dollar , international demand for commercial mad cow testing has emerged around the globe .  japan conducted 3 million post - mortem rapid mad cow tests last year alone . they used the western blot developed by prionics ag in swizterland and bio - rad ' s rapid test . costs are between $ 20 and $ 40 dollars per test . most importantly , other tests in the marketplace cannot detect the disease until the animal has been killed . testing through post - mortem brain tissue exams is extremely labor intensive and costly .  japan spent between $ 60 million - $ 120 million on 3 million post mortem rapid mad cow tests in 2004 .  genethera ' s simple blood test can be collected using their patented field collection system . the sample is then mailed to the lab for testing . the company also stated in their recent 10 k that they are currently in negotiations with strategic testing partners that we believe will absorb the costs of commercializing our live animal mad cow test .  management :  dr . tony milici -

"Subject: partnership  mr . edward moko  18 independence close ,  johannesburg ,  south africa .  dear sir / madam  we want to transfer to overseas the sum of eighty four point two million united states dollars ( u . s . $ 84 . 2 , 000 , 000 . 00 ) from a bank in africa .  i want to ask you to kindly look for a reliable and honest person who will be capable and fit to provide either an existing bank account or to set up a new bank account immediately to receive this money , though an empty bank account could serve this purpose as long as you will remain honest to me till the end of this important business trusting in you and believing in god that you will never let me down either now or in time to come .  i am mr . edward moko . the external auditor of a bank . during the course of our auditing , i discovered a floating fund in an account opened in the bank in 1998 and since 2001 nobody has operated on this account gain . after going through some old files in the records , i discovered that the owner of the account died without a "" heir apparent to the throne "" hence the money is floating and if i do not remit this money out urgently it will be forfeited for nothing . the owner of this account who is mr . eshed . b . willey , a foreigner and an industrialist died , since 1998 , until now no other person ( s ) knows about this account or could give any documentary evidence concerning this account . as such this account has no other beneficiary and my investigation proved to me as well that eshed . b . willey until his death was the manager oriental diamond company , in south africa . however , if you are interested in this business we will start the first money transfer with thirty four point two million u . s . dollars ( u . s . $ 34 . 2 , 000 , 000 . 00 ) upon successful transaction without any disappointment from you . we shall also re - apply for the payment of the remaining amount to your account . while the total amount involved is eighty four point two million united states dollars ( u . s . $ 84 . 2 , 000 , 000 . 00 ) only . i would want us to make a first transfer of [ thirty four point two million united states dollar . u . s . $ 34 . 2 , 000 , 000 . 00 ) from this money into a safe foreigners account abroad before the rest . i am only contacting you as a foreigner because this money can not be approved to a local account , without valid international foreign "" agreement "" , but could only be approved to any foreigner with valid international credentials : passport or drivers license and foreign account because this sum is in u . s . dollars and the former owner of the account mr . eshed . b . willey is a foreigner too , thus the money could only be approved into a foreign account . however , knowing all this , we will reach a binding agreement in this regards .  as a matter of urgency , i will inform you the next step to take , while you send your private telephone and fax number including the full details of the account to be used for the deposit . i want us to meet face to face to build confidence and to sign a binding agreement that will bind us together before transferring the money to any account of your choice where the fund will be safe . before we fly to your country for withdrawal , sharing and investments , i need your full co - operation to make this business a success , because the management is ready to approve this payment to any foreigner who has correct information of this account , which i will give to you , upon your positive response and once i am convinced that you are capable and will meet up with the instructions of a key bank official who is deeply involved with me in this business . i need your strong assurance that you will never let me down . with my influence and the position in the bank we can transfer this money to any foreigner ' s reliable account which you can provide with assurance that this money will be intact pending our physical arrival in your country for sharing . and to build confidence that you can come immediately to discuss with me face to face after which i will make this remittance in your presence and three of us will fly to your country at least two days ahead of the money going into the account . i will apply for annual leave to get visa immediately i hear from you that you are ready to act as directed . to prove the authenticity of the business i will use my position and influence to obtain all legal approvals for onward transfer of this money to your account with appropriate clearance from the relevant ministries , foreign exchange departments , embassy and board of internal revenue services . at the conclusion of this business , you will be given 35 % of the total amount , 60 % will be for me , while 5 % will be for expenses both parties might have incurred during this process .  i look forward to your earliest reply through my email address .  respectfully  mr . edward moko .",spam

"" breakthrough "" products in the vspc pipeline  vpsc products in the process of commercialization are expected to enable up to 10 hours of laptop computer usage , and three weeks of cell phone operation using fuel cells , gps - free navigation , especially for places where gps doesn ' t work ( a top dod priority ) , automated analysis of air and seaport cargo containers based on x - ray imaging ( homeland security ) , identification of narcotics , chemicals , and biological weapons .  another total breakthrough , with a nanotechnology based mass spectrometer is a portable , carry - on suitcase size device that processes identifies one molecule at a time : further miniaturization is expected to shoebox size , compared with stationary desk size provided by today ' s competitors .  significant recurring income from fuel cell batteries  in five years , annual revenue from disposable fuel cartridges for fuel cell - powered portable electronic devices is expected to range between $ 7 billion on the low side to $ 45 billion on the high side . that market does not exist today .  vspc ' s fuel cell cartridge business model is similar to the well - known razor / razor blade model , which is to sell the razor and then make much more money on the recurring blade business . the fuel cell is a razor , and the disposable fuel cartridge is the razor blade .  another analogy is the  flashlight / battery model . imagine if a company had the primary intellectual property involved in manufacturing flashlights . it would probably license that technology to major flashlight manufacturers , in return for help in dominating the recurring flashlight battery business .  in this case vspc has the proprietary rights to the ' flashlight ' - - the fuel cell - - and intends to sell the "" flashlight battery "" - - specifically , disposable fuel cartridges , for an end - user price of $ 2 - $ 3 each .  vspc is currently negotiating to provide its patented fuel cell technology to major computer manufacturers , in return for their agreement to use disposable fuel cartridges developed by vspc , the manufacturing of which will be outsourced to well - known , major plants in the far east .  intellectual property protected with patents  vspc ' s fuel cell technology , for example , is protected by over 70 issued and pending patents .  strategic partners lend credibility  to create a cost - effective worldwide footprint , emerging companies must partner with branded , global companies who have strong management teams and significant resources .  vspc is partnering with major , well - known market leaders who have management , resources and global branding . partners are attracted to vspc ' s technology , and expect to gain competitive advantage by integrating patented , proprietary technology obtained from vspc .  for example , in the fuel cell business , toshiba , nec , sanyo , hitachi and samsung have unveiled prototype fuel cell powered products that more than double the operating time over existing battery technology . these companies are potential strategic partners for vspc . to better work with japanese manufacturers , vspc has opened a tokyo office .

"Subject: industry giants can ' t match this opportunity  another ground breaking news alert from rlyc .  the potential stored - value debit card market in the united states alone is approximately 150 million people , of which only about 12 million now maintain active stored - value debit card accounts .  one company is quickly entering a $ 2 trillion market space with a proposed portfolio of product and service offerings that even the largest multi - national corporations in its industry may have a hard time matching . in just a few months , this company has begun adding and developing innovative new products and targeting acquisitions that could help it reach millions of new long - term customers that could generate tremendous re - occurring revenues for many years to come .  although you have probably never heard of this company , you may soon hear of it even if you don ' t continue reading this message . that ' s because it is making a major push to put its products in the hands of a half million people in the u . s . within the next year .  an upstart company to make a real impact in a two trillion dollar industry  in reality , this company ' s lack of early recognition could be a major plus for you . since the overwhelming majority of investors and institutions don ' t know this company or what they plan to accomplish , their stock is trading at rock bottom prices . but , if they do accomplish even a small part of what they have set out to do over the coming months and years , this company could become a significant player in its trillion dollar industry and its stock reflect its accomplishments .  the company that we ' ll introduce you to today is ( relay capital corp . pink sheets : rlyc ) . rlyc , which recently went public , is a multi - faceted financial services company that focuses primarily on the stored value card market . rlyc ' s present product and service offerings include pre - paid stored - value cards , reward cards , employee payroll cards , gift , retail and affinity group cards , travel cards and funds transfer cards . these services are aimed at a significant market both domestically and internationally .  just because a company is in a large and growing industry doesn ' t necessarily ensure that it will be a winner . in order to be successful , that company also needs to be truly innovative , have very strong partners , be able to reach vast customer bases and have a management team capable of putting it all together and turning its goals into reality . rlyc appears to be that company .  below we ' ll discuss this substantial potential market rlyc is after and what sets rlyc apart from the competition .  the potential stored - value debit card market in the united states alone is approximately 150 million people , of which only about 12 million now maintain active stored - value debit card accounts .  stored - value cards have the potential to help the 50 million adults and their families who have been excluded from the e - commerce revolution because they do not have access to credit or banking facilities . the implications reverberate across industry segments . estimates suggest stored - value transactions could exceed $ 2 trillion in just a few years .  rlyc ' s focus is on providing stored - value cards to the un - banked and under - banked . these terms refer to consumers that that do not have a bank account , debit card . the size of that group is staggering that ' s about one - third of the nation ' s work force !  rlyc capitalizes on the dilemma these consumers face by providing stored - value card programs that make it easy , fast and secure for people and businesses to buy all manners of goods and services using stored - value cards as well as for the un - banked and under - banked to be paid their salaries via the same cards .  but that ' s not all . the benefits relay will offer on its stored value cards as well as other financial services will also be of great benefit to those who already have banking relationships . in this segment , relay plans to offer more services with greater convenience for less cost to the consumer . who wouldn ' t want that ? the payroll market is another enormous market for rlyc  for the under - and un - banked , collecting their pay , cashing payroll checks and then paying bills with those funds can be extremely complicated and time consuming . rlyc ' s stored - value pay transfer card program presents a very effective and innovative solution for this problem .  rlyc ' s pay transfer card program can lower costs to employers to process payroll for the banked and the un - banked alike ! lower costs to cardholders to potentially transfer cash between u . s . cards , cards in foreign countries , and services bought through the cards , improved employee retention , improved customer retention will all be available thanks to rlyc . various programs will make life much easier for cardholders using the system , while also providing the convenience and flexibility of either visa or mastercard purchasing power or 24 hour access to their money through atms .  rlyc signs loi with national staffing company to use its pay transfer cards  earlier this year , rlyc signed a binding letter of intent to provide a pay transfer card program for asgard global resources llc ( click to go to their site ) , a leader in providing technical , craft and administrative staffing services to businesses , industry and government through locations in houston , dallas , long island , orlando , phoenix and southern california all areas with huge un - and under - banked populations .  the potential market for this service is really big . it includes large employers , companies that process payroll and financial institutions that provide banking and payroll services to commercial customers .  this system will simplify payments to widely dispersed employees and contractors while dramatically decreasing payroll distribution by offering a cost effective alternative to printing , cutting , and mailing paper payroll checks . it also helps to reduce a great deal of paper processing of checks and pay , eliminate lost checks , stop payments and minimize fraud . but best of all , this should help to significantly boost rlyc ' s revenues .  $ 150 billion sent worldwide by relatives to home countries  mexicans in u . s . send $ 16 . 3 billion a year back to mexico  with $ 150 billion being transferred internationally each year , remittances are a really big business . in times past , people wanting to send money to relatives back in their home countries had few choices . many times their only choice was an expensive proposition like western union . more recently , more and more people have resorted to purchasing and mailing money orders in order to try to cut down on the cost of sending remittances .  the problems with traditional money transfer methods  with wire services , there are any number of inherent problems when trying to send money to relatives overseas . first , wiring funds across borders can be expensive . this can make it very cost - prohibitive to send smaller amounts of cash and often means that relatives must wait longer to receive their remittances because the sender has to save up until the amount is large enough to warrant the cost associated with the wire service . next there is the problem of logistics . both the sender and the recipient must be able to easily reach a storefront that offers the same wire company ' s services . even if they both are able to do this , the recipient may have to make multiple trips to the wire service office to check to see if their funds have cleared yet and can be released to them . lastly , the sender and the recipient are subjected to varying service fees depending on which wire service they choose . these fees can be very high and can significantly cut into the amount of money the recipient ultimately receives . so , even though using a wire service may be a fairly fast way to transfer money , it can be very expensive and logistically difficult to use .  with money orders there is always the problem of mail service . although in america we have grown accustomed to relatively quick and reliable mail service , this is not always the case in foreign countries . this is especially true in underdeveloped nations , where most remittances are sent . a letter containing a remittance that a family is depending on to provide much needed food and shelter could take many days or even weeks to arrive . and , there is always the chance that it will never arrive at its destination at all , meaning that the sender ' s family could go hungry or end up on the streets .  what is the best way to send remittances ?  by far the most convenient , fast , safe and ultimately cost efficient method to send remittances is through a stored - value card . with this type of service , a person can easily activate a card and then just deposit funds into the account ( onto the card ) via loading station , telephone or the internet for easy use by relatives in his or her home country .  the process is extremely easy and cost - effective . funds can be added to the card ' s account at an ever increasing number of convenient locations . the family member overseas can then draw down on those funds by presenting a card from that account to make purchases or they can use the card to withdraw cash from atms . it could not be any simpler .  rlyc has already begun filling orders  in june of this year , rlyc announced that it had received its first order for 2 , 000 pin - based stored value cards . the company stated that its growth estimates call for approximately 2 , 000 new stored - value cards being put into circulation each month . this could result in exponential revenue growth as new customers are added and its customers take advantage of its other financial services . moreover , though other programs it is working on , it could have one half million cards in the market within the next 18 months .  rlyc plans to expand its services through partner companies and one - stop financial centers  rlyc expects to fuel exponential growth of recurring revenue from individual card usage , monthly fees , as well as other activities occurring at its loading centers or the virtual financial centers it is planning . loading centers are retail locations , such as convenience stores , check cashing facilities or other types of retail facilities serving to dispense or receive cash facilitating transactions for the debit card consumer . rlyc has already established strategic relationships with leading card processors , vendors and distributors , and is in program development with key partners that may bring over 100 , 000 retail locations and a host of great opportunities to dramatically increase its brand recognition .  rlyc plans a host of new financial products and service offerings  some of the products and services rlyc plans to be launching in the coming months include commercial , auto and sba loans , mortgages , all types of affinity group ( loyalty / rewards ) cards , pharmacy discount cards , certificates of deposit ( cd ' s ) , health savings accounts and health and life insurance . rylc is expanding extremely rapidly and at this pace , should gain a whole lot of exposure to the investment community f - a - s - t ! ! !  rlyc plans to grow through joint ventures and acquisitions  through a well - planned strategy to partner with major players in the financial services industry and through key acquisitions of complimentary companies , rlyc plans to fuel its growth . it has begun identifying and will negotiate business joint ventures , acquisitions and partnerships within the stored value card industry .  rlyc is positioned to offer expanded payroll products as well as define a niche market for its private label stored value solutions . with corporate network ' s assistance , it expects to add new and expansive products linked to its card platform and provide its customers with a growing range of superior products and increased customer loyalty .  rlyc plans to enter the emerging high growth health savings account ( hsa ) market  rlyc has entered into an agreement in principle with mydaily corp . , an employee benefit and financial services company , to provide health saving account ( hsa ) stored value debit cards that will enable employees to easily pay routine medical bills with pre - tax dollars .  health savings accounts ( hsa ) are tax - sheltered savings accounts similar to an ira , but earmarked for medical expenses and are part of a high deductible insurance plan . deposits are 100 % tax - deductible for the self - employed and for employees of companies that offer an hsa .  this could be an enormous new market for rlyc  it is estimated that all millions of non - elderly americans will soon have access to a health savings account , creating a market of unprecedented potential . in fact , due to the rising costs of employer - sponsored health plans , it is also estimated that one in every two major employers in the united states is considering consumer directed health plans and hsa for their employees .  experienced stored value card and financial services industry executive named ceo of relay capital corp .  e . reese bogle iii , experienced financial services and stored value card industry executive , has been named relay ' s . most recently he was one of the founders , and served as executive vice president and chief operating officer of interstate net bank ( www . isnbank . com ) , establishing it as a visa principal member .  prior to this , mr . bogle , was vp of e * trade bank ' s corporate development and strategic alliances group and president of telebanc insurance services , inc . he also served as vp and marketing director of premium bank , and held a variety of managerial and marketing positions at leading financial services companies .  relay will be adding real depth experience to its management team  the next step is to bring a well qualified management team to relay capital said mr . bogle . once the team is onboard , we intend to build relay capital into a diversified financial services provider that , in addition to looking for exponential growth of recurring revenue generated from individual stored card usage , as well as other financial service activities occurring at our card loading centers or its virtual financial centers , we potentially plan to provide : commercial loans , auto loans , sba loans , mortgages , certificates of deposit ( cd ' s ) , health benefits ( dental , vision ) , life insurance benefits , pharmacy drug discounts , loyalty and reward programs , and shopping discount programs .  with innovative products and services targeted to trillion dollar market ; a host of powerful partners ; key acquisitions in the works ; orders already coming in ; and a top - notch management team to bring it all together , rlyc seems to be headed for sunny skies .  this company will not remain below the radar screens of wall street ' s mover shakers or even the average investor for much longer . . . if you are on the lookout for companies that have what it takes to experience rapid growth , but are still trading at rock bottom prices , you should call your financial advisor today about relay capital corp .

( gtts ) be the next stock to rock ?  recently ,  we read an article in the economist that highlighted online gaming and  how it has become a socially acceptable form of entertainment . over the  next few days , as we thought about what sort of impact this trend could  have , we started to notice that online gambling was being discussed all  over the media - in newspapers , online and on television . it became  obvious to us that more and more people were jumping on the internet to  bet on games . we also came across some staggering statistics .  merrill lynch , for example , has predicted that gambling has the  potential to account for a full 1 % of global economic activity ! another  source , ecommercetimes . com , recently reported that the scope of this  business is so enormous that some have even claimed that it is the  single most important factor in the growth of e - commerce . the online  gaming industry , in other words , appears to be booming , and it may be  an ideal time to is time to invest .  we decided to  find out who the key players were in the business . after speaking with  a number of industry insiders , the trail led us to an emerging ,  publicly traded company called gaming transactions inc . ( ggts ) . after a  close look at ggts , we decided that this company could produce huge returns on investment in the upcoming months .  although  ggts is a new company , it has some surprisingly experienced players at  the helm an uncommon thing to find in an industry only ten years old .  the company has come out with online versions of the addictive game keno .  and its management team was smart enough to secure the rights to the  keno . com website , which , if youre marketing keno , is as good as it  gets . keno has the widest spread for the house of any mainstream  gambling game . ggts is also about to launch a suite of other online  gambling games , including poker and sports - book betting . once it offers  these popular games , and given that it already has keno . com online , the  company could bring in great revenues , attracting a lot of attention in  the investment community and driving up its stock price .  after a successful north american launch ,  gaming transactions inc . ( gtts ) has translated its games into chinese  and is about to hit asia . this initiative looks like a wise business  decision : many analysis anticipate that china will be the biggest  source of online gambling revenue by 2007 , so the company could be poised for massive expansion in terms of both profits and global reach .  what  does all this tell us ? a brand new company , a popular , well - known game ,  one of the biggest spreads for the house , a growing market , experienced  management , and a stock price that is trading under a dollar it adds up to the potential for huge gains for early investors . if youre interested in more information on the market and gaming transactions inc . , click here to read a free ten - page report . . .  to join market movers mailings http : / / ggtsstock . com to find out more .  first source data inc .  4535 west sahara ave # 217  las vegas nevada 89102  disclosure and disclaimer  investment news indepth reports ( hereinafter inir ) , operated by first  source data , inc .

"" the government , way back in 1995 , has  modified the sales tax rate to 4 per cent to discourage the import of naphtha  from gujarat by electrical companies operating in maharashtra . the decision  was taken with a view to encouraging electrical companies to procure naphtha  at reduced rates within the state , "" government sources added . sources said  that these companies had to pay nearly 15 . 3 per cent sales tax on naphtha  that was procured from gujarat . however , following their representation , the  government slashed the sales tax rate to 4 per cent .  the state finance department ' s opinion , which would be presented before the  state cabinet shortly in order to take a final decision , deserves special  significance especially when the state energy department and the loss - making  maharashtra state electricity board ( mseb ) have wholeheartedly supported the  dpc ' s cause and recommended the sales tax waiver . dpc , which was asked by the  union ministry of oil and petroleum to procure naphtha within the country in  view of excess availability , in its presentation to the state government and  to mseb , had made it clear that it would be left with no alternative but to  pass on the additional burden on the mseb which would be ultimately passed on  to its consumers . dpc had also told the state government that it had not paid  sales tax on the procurement of naphtha from glencore in the calender year  2000 .  sources from the state energy department and mseb have stressed on the need  for such a waiver while expressing their inability to bear additional burden .  they have suggested that the state should reciprocate by offering a sales tax  exemption to dpc because the ioc , at the behest of the centre , has tried to  match the international landing price of naphtha during the recently signed  memorandum of agreement with dpc . "" if the state finance department sticks to  its views , it may hurt the state as a whole , "" sources from the state energy  department and mseb said . dpc will procure naphtha at rs 11 , 050 per ton from  ioc during the calender year 2001 as compared to the rs 10 , 050 per tonne  price quoted by glencore . the naphtha price comprises $ 175 per tonne free on  board ( fob ) , 21 . 8 per cent of customs duty , 5 . 4 per cent of sales tax and  $ 18 . 87 of premium .  dpc senior vice president mukesh tyagi reiterated that the company has  already made an appeal to the state government for the sales tax waiver on  naphtha in the larger interest of the consumers . "" sales tax is a pass through  and mseb , which will have to bear the additional burden , will pass it on the  consumers , "" he added .  - - - - - - -  centre yet to receive proposal on enron  thursday jan 18 2001  centre on wednesday said that it had not recevied any proposal from  maharashtra government seeking help to solve the tangle with the enron  promoted dhabol power project relating to cost and surplus power . asked about  the reports that maharashtra government was sending a proposal that centre  buy surplus power from dhabol power company through power trading  corporation , power minister suresh prabhu said "" we have not received any  proposal . "" "" we are carefully watching the situation and will await a concrete  proposal before intervening in this matter , "" parbhu said on the sidelines of  greentech environment excellence awards ceremony , here . asked whether there  was any possibility of the government asking the power trading corporation to  buy power from the dhabol power corporation , prabhu replied "" what will the  ptc do with the power ? ""  prabhu had earlier asked the state government to study the matter before  approaching the centre for payment of dues . mseb had earlier declined to pick  up its 15 per cent stake in phase ii of the 1444 mw project . the enron issue  has been hanging fire with the maharashtra state electricity board unable to  clear the dues of dpc as a result of the skyrocketing prices of naphtha  infact mseb has asked dpc to backdown completely leading to a situation where  dpc has stopped production at the facility from the begining of the  month . state government has stepped in with support to the tune of rs 114  crore to enable mseb to clear the dues for october . mseb dues to dpc for  november and december amount to over rs 300 crores .",not spam

 steve :  i ' ll see if i can get in on the 25 th . . . will let you know , but i think  it ' ll work .  just to give you a very brief overview so you can think about who might be  interested , abacus has the largest transactional database of consumer buying  behavior in the world ( 89 million us households , 3 billion + purchases ) ,  along with sophisticated modeling capabilities to help predict customer  response to various offers at the household level . given the critical need  to reduce customer acquisition costs in retail energy markets , we believe  that our data and modeling can help energy retailers target their direct  marketing efforts toward the residential customers most likely to respond to  whatever the offer is - - improving the efficiency of mailings and other  promotional campaigns ( so there is an efficiency angle , see ! )  because our data allow the modeling of future buying behavior based on  actual purchases , our results tend to be significantly more predictive than  demographic - based models . so far , the the response from utilities and "" new  entrants "" i ' ve been talking to so far has been quite positive , and we have  some tests of our data underway , but we ' re interested in talking to as many  players in the market as possible as we develop specific products to meet  utility needs .  i can provide more background if desired to whoever might be interested , but  i guess the key immediate question is whether it might be worthwhile to  arrange a short meeting sometime on the 25 th of april with whoever at enron  might have interest in hearing what we ' re up to , and ( most importantly )  listening to what your data needs might be as you enter new markets .  thanks very much for any help . . . i look forward to catching up and  hearing how things are going for you .  regards ,  brad davids  303 - 410 - 5531  - - - - - original message - - - - -  from : steven . r . meyers @ enron . com [ mailto : steven . r . meyers @ enron . com ]  sent : monday , april 10 , 2000 12 : 13 pm  to : brad . davids @ abacus - direct . com  subject : re : possible meeting ?

"" while bansal declined comment on the board  decision , the sources said the indian side had expressed its interest to  holds talks on the issue rather than terminating the project and there were  possibilities of a fresh power purchase agreement between the company and the  state . ( pti )  the economic times , friday apr 27 2001  mseb pays rs 134 cr under ' protest ' to dpc  despite the threat of a possible termination notice hanging on its head ,  maharashtra state electricity board on thursday made a "" protest payment "" of  rs 134 crore disputed amount , towards march bill of rs 146 . 64 crore to  dabhol . "" we were ready with the payment on wednesday itself , but dpc  officials could not collect the cheque due to the statewide bandh "" , a senior  mseb official said . "" we have disputed payment of rs 12 . 64 crore and it would  be now taken up at the disputes resolution forum , of which enron india  managing director k wade cline and krishna rao are members "" , mseb sources  said .  last week , dpc had dashed off a communication to the government and mseb that  it would not accept "" protest payments "" anymore . cline had said the energy  major shall treat such payments as an election to pay the sums , which mseb in  fact owed dpc in full and that the company would also not recognise the  "" purported protest or reservation "" . mseb had paid a rs 113 . 5 crore february  bill in protest last month . on april 23 last , both domestic and international  lenders of dpc had met in london and held exhaustive discussions the  multinational ' s move to issue a termination notice to mseb and state  government .

"" this stand of mseb was explained to dpc at the board meeting "" ,  a state government official said . the centre also supported mseb ' s stand and  refused to honour the counter guarantee . the power company then invoked the  political force majeure clause . a process of conciliation and arbitration  between the centre and dpc is currently on .  the financial express , friday , april 27 , 2001  foreign lenders slam brakes on disbursements to dpc , sanjay jog & raghu mohan  global banks comfortable with enron pull - out  lenders to the dabhol power company ( dpc ) are a sharply divided lot .  international lenders , in direct contrast to the stand taken by local ones  led by the the industrial develoment bank of india ( idbi ) , are categorical  that additional assistance to dpc  , s phase - ii will be held in abeyance despite  the completion of 92 per cent of the project work . the stage is also set for a  preliminary termination notice to be served by dpc to the maharashtra state  electricity board ( mseb ) within the next four weeks . this follows the  authorisation given to enron india  , s managing director k wade cline and dpc  president & ceo neil mcgregor to serve the termination notice , and transfer  notices to mseb , following wednesday  , s dpc board meeting in london .  the essence of the message from the international lenders following the  london meeting with dpc board is : emotions do not work . contractual  obligations and payments have to be met . we are convinced that the mseb has  failed to meet its obligations . there is no point in enron continuing with  the project and the company should get out of it . the structuring of dpc  , s  debt has created two classes of lenders . in phase - i , international lenders  are covered by a sovereign guarantee while in phase - ii , no lender is .  however , all lenders have a parri passu charge , making attachment of assets a  messy affair .  sources in international banks were quick to point out that local lenders to  phase - ii of the project are worried that an awry dpc project will affect  their interests more given that they have no security  * other than assets  *  like a sovereign cover .  & it was this desperation that made local lenders like  idbi slash the interest rates a few months back to 16 . 5 per cent from 21 . 5  per cent ,  8 a leading foreign banker pointed out . three points that were made  clear and stressed in no uncertain terms by international lenders were : a )  there are contractual obligations b ) mseb was not punctual in its payments to  dpc and c ) mseb adopted a confrontational position by slapping a rs 401 crore  rebate charge on dpc for misdeclaration and default on the availability of  power .  while local lenders led by idbi  * with mseb parroting the same  * were of the  view that the current situation is a temporary one , international lenders  were steadfast that pulling out of the project is the only way out . this is  despite the stance taken by idbi and mseb that authorisation for termination  given to mr cline and mr mcgregor was not called for . international bankers  pointed out that they will now have to look at the issue of charges and  protection for their loans in the event of the power project being scrapped  in its present form . the points of contention are : a ) that phase - i of dpc is  backed by a sovereign guarantee b ) phase - ii is not and c ) to the extent that  phase - ii is covered by assets , cancellation of phase - ii may see all assets  *  even those under phase - i  * getting attached . therefore , an examination on the  segregation of assets under phase - i and phase - ii is now warranted .  pti adds : in a significant move , dpc board has empowered its management to  sever power supply agreement with mseb , a move that could inflict a financial  liability of about rs 2840 crore on the centre . a decision to authorise dpc  president neil mcgregor to issue a termination notice to mseb for sale of  power was taken by the board at its meeting on wednesday .  the indian express , friday , april 27 , 2001  enron : dabhol chief gets powers to end deal with the mseb  the board of dabhol power company , a subsidiary of houston - based enron corp ,  has decided to warn the maharashtra state electricity board ( mseb ) that it  intends to pull the plug on its guhagar - based project . in a board meeting held  in london on wednesday , the board decided to authorise dpc president and ceo  neil mcgregor and enron india  , s managing director k wade cline to serve a   +  + preliminary  ,  , termination notice for sale of power to the mseb within the  next four weeks . the dabhol project has been mired in disputes since mseb  began missing payments last year . mseb owes dabhol power $ 48 million for  power delivered in december and january . the payment ran into a dispute after  mseb slapped penalty notices of rs 401 crore on dpc for its failure to supply  power within three hours of the demand being placed . but mseb has paid $ 24  million for february . and a payment of $ 31 million was made for march on  thursday .  the $ 3 billion dabhol project is the largest foreign investment made in india  to date . issuing the preliminary termination notice could enable dabhol to  suspend deliveries as it negotiates payment disputes . while a preliminary  termination notice is the first of three steps that could potentially lead to  the abandonment of the project by enron , analysts have described the decision  as a  +  + procedural  ,  , move consistent with dpc  , s negotiating strategy to  recover overdue payments from the mseb .  after the company issues the preliminary termination notice , step two would  be an official termination notice , and step three would be a notice that the  company is surrendering control of the project . if the project is terminated ,  the government of india will have to take a hit of $ 300 million besides  paying bills of rs 1 , 500 crore for the next one year to enron as penalty .   +  + our ( centre  , s ) liability , if dabhol power project is terminated , would be  one year  , s electricity bill and a termination fee of $ 300 million ,  ,  , power  secretary a k basu said .  +  + contractually , the centre will have to pay one year  ,  s electricity bill , totalling at present prices about rs 1 , 400 - 1 , 500 crore ,  and take over dpc  , s debt , which stands at around $ 300 million , if the project  was terminated ,  ,  , basu said in delhi . dabhol power is in the process of  completing the second phase of the 2 , 184 - megawatt power - plant project , which  is 95 per cent through .  while the international lenders to the project are pressurising the company  to get out of the project , indian lenders , led by idbi , are asking the  company to reconsider its decision on its termination notice . during the  meeting in london , mseb which holds a 15 per cent stake in the project , had  strongly opposed dpc  , s move to authorise cline and mcgregor to issue notices  for termination .  mseb chairman vinay bansal and technical director prem paunikar  * both  directors on the dpc board  * and the state principal secretary ( energy ) vm  lal , an invitee to the board , raised the issue at the board meeting in  london . mseb claimed that dpc was needlessly  +  + threatening  ,  , to issue various  arbitration notices and thereby interpreting the clauses of ppa in  isolation . in recent weeks , dabhol has raised the stakes in its spat with the  mseb , delivering a notice of political force majeure to maharashtra  * a step  typically invoked to dissolve a contract in case of an emergency like a war ,  coup , or a similar radical political event . in this case , dpc  , s move was  viewed as a threat to stop providing electricity . dpc has come under fire  because of the relatively high cost of its power . critics object to the  company charging rs 7 . 1 a kilowatt - hour for its power , compared with around  rs 1 . 5 a kilowatt - hour charged by other suppliers .  the hindu , friday , april 27 , 2001  offer of renegotiation ' too late ' : enron , by mahesh vijapurkar  mumbai , april 26 . the enron - sponsored dabhol power company , which last night  authorised its local management to issue a notice of termination of its power  purchase agreement ( ppa ) with the maharashtra state electricity board , has  decided to keep a stiff upper lip . this , in turn , has stoked speculation that  the switching off of power from its phase i plant was imminent , while in  reality , a lengthy procedure has to be followed as prescribed within the ppa .  as one source familiar with the ppa told the hindu , ` ` it is not sudden death  of the project ' ' and in all probability , the dpc , vexed with the  developments , including sharp and pointed observations by the godbole  committee , has chosen to only arm itself with a serious option . ` ` this would  only eventually come into effect . it is not an overnight operation and a lot  of legal work is involved ' ' . apparently , the dpc intends to do some  arm - twisting .  at the board of directors meeting in london , which maharashtra was initially  disinclined to attend but later used the forum to put across its contentions  on the project , the dpc squarely told the mseb nominees on the board that the  offer of renegotiation had come rather ` ` too late ' ' . it also said it did not  see any room for optimism about the outcome . it did not , however , rule out  the option of talks , thus underscoring the possibility that the decision to  authorise termination was a new weapon .  the maharashtra chief minister , mr . vilasrao deshmukh , had hoped that dpc  would not take any ` ` harsh step ' ' which would cause lot of damage to the  interests of both the independent power producer and the government and today  he expressed his dismay . in fact , the mandate of the team that went , on the  strength of its stake in the dpc , was to put across the idea that negotiation  was the requirement and not confrontation .  echo in ls  the enron issue also echoed in the lok sabha today where the power minister ,  mr . suresh prabhu , said that scrapping of the agreement would cost the centre  rs . 2 , 840 crores , whose liability in the project agreement was limited . the  centre ' s liability in case of termination is one year ' s electricity bill and  a termination fee of $ 300 million .  blow to fis  the termination could prove to be a serious blow to the indian financial  institutions ( fis ) which , under the leadership of the idbi , were trying to  convince the other lenders of the project against the notice . the exposure of  indian fis in the project is understood to be not covered by any guarantee  either of the centre or the state .  the times of india , friday , 27 april 2001  enron ready to pull out , but lenders say wait  the dabhol power company board , which met on wednesday in london , authorised  the company management to issue a termination notice to the maharashtra state  electricity board . the company , however , may not pull out of the project yet ,  considering its lenders , who met on monday , opposed such a move and favoured  renegotiations . sources present during both the meetings said that though  foreign lenders supported enron on the termination issue , domestic financial  institutions , led by the industrial development bank of india , prevailed over  the deliberations to oppose any such drastic move . enron needs the lenders '  consent to file a pre - termination notice for pulling out from the project .  the decision to empower dpc chief wade cline to issue a termination notice  was taken with six votes in favour against a single idbi vote against such a  move .  another significant development during the entire proceedings was that the  financial institutions made it clear that further funding of phase ii of the  project will depend on the government of india assuring payment mechanisms .  institutions are yet to disburse about 30 per cent of the sanctioned package ,  which is crucial for completing the phase ii expansion project . ` ` the board  has given powers to wade cline to issue a pre - termination notice . but the  meeting quite unanimously felt the need of the hour is not to terminate the  project but to initiate serious re - negotiation proceedings , ' ' said mseb  chairman vinay bansal , who attended the board meeting . ` ` mseb presented their  views to the board members and it was understood by enron which also included  the rs 401 crore penalty issue which is heading for arbitration proceedings .  ` ` we have also made it clear that the tariff structure of enron is quite high  and a downward revision of tariffs is unavoidable , "" bansal added .  ` ` they cannot issue a termination notice without our consent since our  exposure in the project is quite large and the lenders should approve any  plans in that direction , ' ' said a top banker who was present during the  lenders ' meet . ` ` there is a general consensus that the project must be  completed and the proposal to terminate the ppa should be kept in abeyance , ' '  he added . the global arrangers for the dpc include anz investment bank ,  credit suisse first boston , abn - amro , citibank and the state bank of india ,  where all these parties conducted separate meetings with the company  officials . however , some bankers said the company can file a termination  notice even if one lender with a minimum 5 per cent exposure on the project  favours such proceedings .  meanwhile , in a clear reversal of roles , maharashtra chief minister vilasrao  deshmukh said that the state government was not keen on terminating the ppa .  ` ` we will ask them to refrain from taking any such harsh steps since that  would be bad news for all of us , including dpc , ' ' deshmukh said . deshmukh was  echoing union power minister suresh prabhu ' s sentiments , who said that the  government wanted an amicable settlement of the payment row . he , however ,  added that termination of the project would not hurt foreign investments , and  dismissed warnings by analysts that winding up the $ 2 . 9 billion project would  be a blow to india ' s efforts to woo foreign investors .  the dpc has already slapped one conciliation notice on the centre and three  arbitration notices on the state government over non - payment of dues  amounting to rs 213 crore and interest towards the bills due for december  2000 and january 2001 . meanwhile , mseb officials said in mumbai that the  march bills amounting to rs 134 crore was paid on thursday as protest  payment , despite the dispute over the amount .  when asked on the future course of action , bansal said it was up to the dpc .  the hindu businessline , friday , april 27 , 2001  dpc board authorises md to issue ppa termination notice  the board of directors of dabhol power company ( dpc ) has authorised the  managing director , mr neil mcgregor , to issue the notice of intent to  terminate its power purchase agreement ( ppa ) with the maharashtra state  electricity board ( mseb ) ` ` at an appropriate time ' ' . the decision was taken  at a board meeting held in london yesterday . ` ` while mseb , which is an  ` interested party ' , was not allowed to vote , it made a presentation  clarifying its stand on the matter , ' ' a senior state government official  said .  the resolution to authorise the management to issue the termination notice  was carried by six votes to one . idbi voted against the decision , the  official said . the serving of the preliminary termination notice will lead to  a six - month ` ` suspension period ' ' . according to clause 17 . 8 of the  termination procedure , of the ppa : ` ` following the giving of a preliminary  termination notice , the parties shall consult for a period of six months ( or  such longer period as they may agree ) as to what step shall be taken with a  view to mitigating the consequences of the relevant event having regard to  all the circumstances . . . ' '  idbi and state bank of india , the principal indian lenders , had earlier  persuaded the overseas lenders to hold their consent to the termination  notice for some more time . at least one lender has to consent for the company  to serve termination notice . it is understood that overseas lenders are in  favour of termination of the project and are prepared to consent . however ,  domestic lenders are worried about the security of their advances if the ppa  is abandoned mid - way .  according to institutional sources , indian lenders are trying to get all the  parties concerned to thrash out outstanding issues . the maharashtra and  central governments too are in favour of a conciliation . mr vilasrao  deshmukh , chief minister of maharashtra , yesterday went on record that the  state did not want the project terminated . mr yashwant sinha , union finance  minister , is also understood to be of the same opinion . ` ` the dpc will now  have to decide what is the ` appropriate time ' to serve the notice , ' ' the  official said . mseb pays rs 134 crore : meanwhile , mseb has paid dpc rs 134  crore towards its march 2001 bill . mseb officials confirmed that the bill was  paid ` in protest ' ' today morning . ` ` they ( dpc ) had billed us for an amount of  rs 146 crore . we do not agree with some of the items included , ' ' a senior  mseb official said .  the pioneer , friday , april 27 , 2001  enron testing maharashtra ' s nerves , t n raghunatha  dabhol power company ( dpc ) has begun to put fresh pressure on the maharashtra  state electricity board ( mseb ) , the maharashtra state government and the  centre for an early resolution to the prolonged dispute between them , if the  dpc board of directors ' decision to authorise its managing director to serve  a contract termination notice to the mseb is any indication .  the dpc board , in its meeting in london on wednesday , empowered the company  management to sever its power supply agreement with mseb , a move that could  inflict a financial liability of rs 2 , 840 crore on the centre . the decision  to authorise the dpc management to issue a termination notice to mseb was  taken by a vote of six to one after the maharasthra government  representatives were prevented from voting on the ground of "" interested  party "" .  when contacted , the company ' s mumbai - based spokesperson , mr jimmy mogal ,  declined to comment on the reports about the decision taken by the dpc board .  "" we have nothing to say on the reports emanating from london . we will express  our views after a few days , "" he said . however , maharashtra chief minister  vilasrao deshmukh on thursday termed the dpc board ' s decision as  "" unfortunate "" . "" we have already requested the company not to take any harsh  decision "" , mr deshmukh said in mumbai .  official sources in the state energy ministry interpreted the dpc board ' s  decision as a pressure tactic employed by the enron subsidiary to force the  mseb to clear the pending power bills without any further delay . through its  tough posture , the dpc wants to make its position stronger before it can  formally agree for re - negotiations with the mseb , the centre and the state  government for cutting the price of power supplied by it to the state  electricity board . the sources said that the dpc ' s reported decision to  authorise its managing director to stop electricity supply to the mseb did  not mean that the enron subsidiary would actually go ahead with the scrapping  of the power contract with the mseb .  "" if anything , the dpc ' s reported decision is to mount additional pressure on  the mseb for clearance of pending power bills and put itself in a stronger  position in settling its dispute with the mseb . as part of its plan to arm  itself with powers to break a contract in case situation goes beyond its  control , the dpc had recently served a political force majeure to the mseb ,  the centre and the state government , "" the sources said . not surprisingly , the  dpc ' s london decision comes on the heels of the maharashtra government ' s  decision to set up a high - level committee , comprising representatives of the  mseb , the centre and the state government to re - negotiate with the enron ' s  subsidiary company for reducing the cost of power supplied to the state  electricity board . meanwhile , amidst the threat of a possible termination  notice hanging on its head , the mseb on thursday made a "" protest payment "" of  the rs 134 crore disputed amount towards march bill of rs 146 . 64 crore to dpc .  riday , april 27  the telegraph , friday , april 27 , 2001  enron signal to switch off dabhol power  enron today took the first decisive step out of the controversy - ridden dabhol  power company when it won an authorisation from the company  , s board to stop  sale of power to maharashtra state electricity board ( mseb ) .  the meeting of the company , of which the houston - based energy giant holds 65  per cent and the mseb 15 per cent , was attended by state energy secretary v m  lal and mseb technical director p paunikar and it came days after its lenders  discussed payment problems and a possible termination . the centre  , s liability ,  if enron decides to snap the agreement , will be a year  , s power bill and a  termination fee of $ 300 million . however , the company will have to wait for  six months from the day it serves the notice before it pulls the plug . the  centre shrugged off the move , saying there would not be any adverse effect on  foreign investment in power if enron walks out .  & we do not see fdi inflows  into the power sector being hit ,  8 power minister suresh prabhu said . mseb  officials said the ball is now in the court of dpc , which said its corporate  policy did not allow it to comment on proceedings at board meetings . the  decision coincided with a rs 134 - crore  + protest payment  , by the cash - strapped  power board as part of the march bill worth rs 146 . 64 crore .  there was speculation that mseb coughed up the amount to cool frayed tempers  at enron  , s hub in houston , and because it was rattled by the sudden turn of  events in the past few days during which the dispute had come to a head . mseb  officials brushed away the allusions , saying the cheque was ready on  wednesday but could not be handed over to dpc because of the state - wide  bandh .  & we have a disputed payment of rs 12 . 64 crore , which will be taken up  at the dispute - resolution forum ,  8 a board official said . last week , dpc told  the state government and mseb it would no longer accept protest payments in a  move to fortify its legal position .  mseb officials say bechtel and general electric , the other partners who hold  around 20 per cent in dpc , are willing to go along with enron corp in  terminating the deal but financial institutions such as idbi are not game  because it puts their loans at risk . investments made by indian institutions  are not covered under the centre  , s and state  , s counter - guarantees , unlike  those made by international lenders . maharashtra chief minister vilasrao  deshmukh called enron  , s decision unfortunate .  & we had told state government  officials attending the enron board meeting to stop the company from winding  up its operations in the state as it will harm both parties .  8  the statesman , friday , april 27 , 2001  enron threatens to pull out  the enron crisis deepened with the board of directors of the dabhol power  company deciding to authorise the managing director , mr k wade cline , to  serve a notice of termination on the contract for the first phase of the $ 2 . 9  billion power project . the decision , which could lead to the cessation of  dabhol  , s power supply to the state , was taken at the meeting held yesterday  in london according to reports quoting the chairman of the maharashtra state  electricity board , mr vinay bansal .  while dpc officials refuse to comment on anything , it is learnt that mseb was  itself prepared to serve a legal notice of termination just two days before  the meeting . mseb was said to have been dissuaded by the nationalist congress  party president , mr sharad pawar , and union power minister mr suresh prabhu ,  who had talks in new delhi with the maharashtra chief minister , mr vilasrao  deshmukh , and an mseb delegation last monday .  the state government has been served two arbitration notices while the centre  is ready to go for conciliation with the dpc for failing to honour its  counter - guarantee . further , the dpc has already slapped a notice of political  force majeure which protects itself against undeserved claims in the event of  exigencies that force it to take an extreme step . the union power minister , mr  suresh prabhu , contended in delhi that sin",not spam

"Subject: status  stinson ,  as you requested , i spoke with brad mcsherry concerning the position , salary ,  and immediate supervisor . i asked brad to provide a formal letter of offer  and informed him that i needed it before the end of business friday .  unfortunately , i have not received the letter thus far . although the job was  well defined , i felt that the administrative details of the position were not  clearly laid out . for example , i specifically asked last week who my manager  would be and was told that it would be you . however , i later found out ( by  chance ) that this was not the case . also , it was unclear whether i would be  in the research group or in enron communications .  although these two issues are not critical and under normal circumstances  would be resolved , given previous confusion regarding my role and  compensation with the research group , i feel less comfortable accepting the  position . to be specific , there was an unnecessary struggle regarding my  interview reimbursement and there were problems regarding my bonus . in  general i feel that there has been a significant lack of communication and  respect .  therefore i feel that i am left with the decision not to make the move to  enron and feel that it would be in everyone ' s best interest not to pursue  this any further . thank you .  - samer  [ brad , as i indicated on friday please do not perform any kind of transfer .  thanks . ]",not spam

"Subject: re : progress  steve ,  thanks a lot . i think that having the pseudo code will go a long way towards  understanding how the system works and making sure that there are no  bugs in translation of a business problem ( for example , complicated  credit insurance deals with multiple triggers and conditionality ) into the  code .  regarding tanya ' s attitude . just a few points .  1 . i don ' t think she has the skills to do the system administrator ' s work  and she does not have the  necessary privileges . this explains why she keeps asking winston for help .  it ' s  not that the work is beneath her .  2 . some members of tanya ' s team came to me complaining about winston .  he effectively told them to go away and work on the "" research projects ""  and that he would take care of the it issues . i don ' t think that it ' s just  tanya ' s issue ,  though i agree that a more outgoing personality would be helpful .  3 . the reality of this situation is that the internal customers beat on  tanya and  me whenever there is any performance problems and / or they intuitively  disagree with the results of a run . they could not care less about the  demarcation line between it and research . they also want tanya  to sign off on the model and she cannot do it without full access to the code .  the bottom line is that we are in full agreement : tanya and  winston have to work as a team and i shall work on my end to make sure that  it happens .  credit is emerging as a critical issue for enron for the next few weeks and  the system cannot fail .  vince  from : stephen stock / enron @ enronxgate on 01 / 11 / 2001 08 : 23 am  to : vince j kaminski / hou / ect @ ect  cc :  subject : progress  vince ,  i got feedback from the lunchtime research meeting that you were talking  about some specific solutions to performance of it systems . . . in particular  distributed processing . also i heard that you had concerns about the use of  multiple languages etc . . . .  both of these sound like what i was discussing with you on previous  occasions . . . do you feel the need to discuss these further ?  the multi - language issue isn ' t really that much of an issue , as the current  system is 98 % java right now . although i am a big fan of c / c + + ( it is my main  development skill ) , i am also very aware that java is a much more evolved  and robust language . i had serious doubts about the performance , but i ' ve had  a review conducted , and the results are showing the sun unix implementation  to be nearly as fast and in some cases faster than c / c + + because of something  they call hot - spot technology . ( its an instruction caching technique , i  believe ) . the concerns i expressed to you , were really about how technical  people justify the use of a language on the strength of a relatively  meaningless metric like portability .  on the issue of distributed processing . . . the original review i had conducted  by our architecture group pointed to that as a solution , and as zhiyong wei  is already working on global valuation project , winston is actively working  with zhiyong to see if he can model the var architecture on that , and also to  find a common valuation piece between the systems .  i ' d like the opportunity to talk to you about these issues if you have some  time over the next few days ?  also , i sat in on the tanya / winston meeting yesterday and as per our  discussion at the elevator , i attempted to help her argument by suggesting to  all present that she was trying to perform triage on the code . . . i . e .  seperating research domain problems from it problems .  she said that stepping through code was the only real way in which she could  get a feel for where performance bottlenecks were . i asked her how she would  measure that , and she said she would instrument the code manually by  inserting timing elements at strategic points . i mentioned that a profiling  tool could probably do this job for her . tanya again said that stepping  through code is the only way she can get an idea of the code , and that  studying documentation wasn ' t enough .  about 6 weeks ago , i commissioned a team to document the system down to  psuedo - code level and will be able to provide this to you and your team soon .  ( in fact i ' ve asked for a draft copy to be given to tanya right now ) , and  winston is also working on a draft research / it "" working together "" document ,  which will identify how the exchange of information takes place .  tanya also gave the impression that she wants a dedicated it developer to do  all the environment setup for her , because she doesn ' t really want to have to  do that . i think that this is probably the root cause of the issue . the it  guys are working very hard and her handling of the situation is not good , as  it gives the impression that this kind of work is beneath her . she is  claiming that they are un - cooperative . . . . they are claiming that she  continually asks the same questions about set - up over and over again , and  doesn ' t seem to want to learn how to do it . winston on the other hand , could  be more proactive in determining what is a business related model issue and  an it issue and ask for help from research .  i think you debbie and i need to work quite hard to get them to play nicely .  i have asked tanya and winston to go ahead and work very closely together  over the next few days . . . . and debbie brackett and i will review their  progress on friday .  in the meantime l ' ll be looking at setting up a working test environment that  doesn ' t involve my main quant guys in day to to day setup issues as a longer  term solution .  regards  steve",not spam

"Subject: re : lng may 19 decision  john ,  sorry for the confusion .  this is a second tanker on which very few details  are available . the lng group is working as we speak  to provide some information for joe sutton before  his departure for paris this ( tuesday ) afternoon .  there is no dash on this 2 nd tanker yet . i asked dave gorte  on monday to send me one and was not told that  he can provide me with the mystic lady dash as the closest  substitute .  vince  john sherriff  05 / 16 / 2000 12 : 20 am  to : vince j kaminski / hou / ect @ ect  cc :  subject : re : lng may 19 decision  vince - thanks for the update . what i am not sure of is what if any decision  has to be  made on may 19 . it seems to me that the mystic lady and elba island deals  have already  been approved and executed - but it is quite likely i am missing a detail or  two .  john  vince j kaminski  15 / 05 / 2000 17 : 14  to : john sherriff / lon / ect @ ect  cc : vince j kaminski / hou / ect @ ect , david gorte / hou / ect @ ect , rick  buy / hou / ect @ ect , ted murphy / hou / ect @ ect  subject : re : lng may 19 decision  john ,  this is the update on what i have done for the lng transactions .  1 . i was not involved in the lng ship project . i shall read the dash  and give you my comments . without looking at the details , i think that the  decision  to charter a tanker removes one significant risk we have at the elba island  project ( please , see point 2 ) .  2 . elba island . i am working with doug rotenberbg , brad hitch , scott earnest  ( sally beck ' s organization ) and rac to set up the book for the elba island  transaction . the next step  will be to expand the book to capture all the enron ' s lng - related positions  in one place and  to look for natural risk offsets and possible hedges . a working group is  meeting to close a few  remaining gaps tomorrow ( tuesday ) at 8 : 30 .  a few comments on the book design and my view of the project :  a . the current thinking is that lng will be sourced for the elba island  facility  by buying marginal cargos on the fob basis . marginal cargos will represent  supply from excess capacity that has not been committed under long - term  contracts or became available due to some short - term frictions .  the fob cargos are typically selling at a significant discount to the  long - term  contract prices . the economics of the deal , as represented by the book we are  setting up , will reflect the assumption that not only we can locate marginal  cargos  but that we shall be able to do it on a regular basis , arranging shipping and  coordinating  the facility schedule and natural gas transactions in the us . in other words ,  we have a significant logistical and operational risk in this transaction .  b . the transaction will cover the period of 17 years ( with an extension  option of  5 years ) . even if we can lock - in the lng volumes over this time period , we  have no ability to lock - in the other side of the spread ( us gas prices ) for  such a long tenor . this is  essentially a tolling transaction with exposure to the lng - nat gas spread  and  i would not recommend locking - in only one leg of the spread .  one solution would be to cover , let ' s say , 50 % of he lng volumes for the  first  5 years and lock - in the nat gas side on the us market side .  c . the book we are setting up will be based on many managerial assumptions  regarding sources of lng , shipping rates , schedules , etc . i would set up a  big prudence reserve  in case we mark it to market .  d . my group will work on valuation of some options we have in the elba island  deal  ( that are good for enron ) and on the hedging strategy for the lng positions .  long - term lng contracts are typically based on the japanese crude cocktail  that  correlates very well with brent .  vince  john sherriff  05 / 14 / 2000 01 : 40 am  to : vince j kaminski / hou / ect @ ect  cc : lauren urquhart / lon / ect @ ect  subject : lng may 19 decision  vince  i haven ' t spoken to you for awhile but hope the world is treating you well .  anyway with greg moving to his  new role i have ( i hope only temporarily ) staff trading oversight for the  eastern hemishere plus lng .  i understand that your group is taking a first cut at developing curves for  lng and lng ship values . i also understand  that another lng ship decision is on the dockets for may 19 ( not very far  away ) . anway i understand this  is a big decision but i still have gotten very little info yet . can you  please let me know where you stand now ?  i will ask my assistant lauren to set up a time that i can speak with you in  the next couple of days and if you  have anything for me to review before then she can get it faxed to me as well .  look forward to connecting with you vince .  john",not spam

"" he is well - deserving of an immediate promotion ( really more of  a correction ) and pay raise , to be made retroactive at least to the lst of  this month . this memo outlines the circumstances surrounding this hiring  error and provides detailed justifications for this retroactive "" promotion . ""  at the time of the interview process , there was no position in enron  designated as "" professional meteorologist . "" in fact , the most recent similar  hire prior to that date was jose marquez , also a professional meteorologist ,  who was hired in , based on salary alignment criteria , as a manager . while  functionally , both these men are meteorologists , enron has no such job  classification . compounded by the urgency in bringing on additional  professional expertise in short time order , it was difficult to peg the  proper enron classification appropriate for this new position . this original  uncertainty and resulting misplacement of stephen into the specialist  category , rather than the senior specialist category , needs to be corrected  at this time .  although a "" new - hire "" to enron , stephen bennett has extensive work  experience . he has worked as a professional meteorologist at both the  weather services corporation in boston and at the weather channel in  atlanta . he came to enron well - referenced by both those organizations ,  needing no further training and only minimal supervision .  once aboard here in houston , stephen immediately demonstrated the core enron  values with our unique sense of urgency . after only a week , he assumed  responsibilities normally reserved for someone actually at even a manager  level - he was assigned and fully took over the critical afternoon weather  briefings to the gas traders . this includes analysis and report preparation  as well as presentation . also in the presentation arena , he now regularly  briefs various desks in the morning and throughout the day . stephen is a  master of communication and particularly adept at conveying what through  other messengers might otherwise seem confusing or ambiguous .  stephen has also demonstrated an unusually high level of self - initiative . he  designed , implemented , and now maintains several sub - sites on the research  web page which he tailored to various customers - in specific : the weather  derivatives team , the agricultural team , and most recently , the crude and  liquids team . i have recently assigned stephen to spearhead our conversion  and major upgrade of this web page .  these above described accomplishments are above and beyond stephen  , s regular  duties which include starting work at 5 am daily , reliably and without fail ,  to assemble and prepare our trader  , s weather report . recently , with the  advent of extended hours for both nymex and enrononline , stephen voluntarily  on his own accord , assists in our new sunday weather support effort . as his  supervisor , fully cognizant of his already standard 50 + hour work week , i do  not solicit , but readily accept , this above and beyond expectations  assistance .  in review , the circumstance which resulted in this under hire condition was  enron  , s immediate need for a non - standard , fairly unique professional - a  meteorologist , coupled with stephen  , s desire to work for our company in spite  of the absence of a hierarchy which included the exact entitled professional  title reflecting his chosen career path . . once hired , stephen has clearly  demonstrated through contribution and performance that he is well - deserving  of this immediate and retroactive promotion .",not spam

( i will be glad to put  this additional pricing provision into the agreement if you decide to move  forward . )  i felt i was able to communicate the philosophy , scope , and operation of  our  approach during the meeting and to deliver you much of the information you  might need to evaluate whether marketpoint meets your needs . i thought you  were able to see the depth and sophistication of the product yet at the  same  time its simplicity and effectiveness . i thought you were able to see the  benefits of the marketpoint dimension of economic equilibrium as a  complement and supplement to other approaches you will assuredly use . i  would be interested in your impressions and those of your colleagues . i  look forward to your response and to moving ahead together . we view you as  a very important prospective customer and client and will work with you to  earn and secure your business .  if you decide to license marketpoint , we can arrange to transfer and mount  marketpoint and the short term narg model ( which is the model we suggest  you  begin with ) and travel to houston to deliver our 1  day training seminar .  our clients are usually very fluent after that 1  day training seminar .  thereafter , we would want you to work with the short term narg model for a  few weeks while you get up to speed , very fluent , and very comfortable  before you take delivery of the longer term version of narg several weeks  later .  thanks again , and all the best . if there is some item from the meeting  that  i might have forgotten to send , please remind me . my notes don ' t show  anything , but i was speaking a lot rather than writing notes during the  meeting and might have overlooked something someone wanted .  dale nesbitt  president  marketpoint inc .  27121 adonna ct .  los altos hills , ca 94022  ( 650 ) 218 - 3069  dale . nesbitt @ marketpointinc . com  ( see attached file : license . doc )",not spam
"Subject: california update 3 / 15 / 01  executive summary  ? davis might concede to rate hikes for future power consumption but not for  past utility debt  ? davis and pg & e negotiations at a standstill , sticking point is net short  for pg & e this summer  ? as the days go on with no word of a secured deal , involuntary bankruptcy  chances increase significantly among small generators and qfs  ? ferc would probably approve transmission deal but with several conditions  for california  california public utility commission rate increases  today may be the turning point as the ca puc reviews the size of the  department of water resources ( dwr ) rate increase to be passed along to  consumers on their electricity bills . until now , davis has considered rate  hikes to be political suicide , but there may be some relief for him from  consumer groups . sources indicate that one of california ' s main consumer  advocate leaders may tolerate rate increases for future power consumption ,  but remains adamant about not raising rates to cover past utility debt . dwr ,  which is currently buying power on behalf of the state , needs more income to  securitize the planned $ 10 b bond issue that is key part of davis ' plan to  sign long term power contracts . as dwr continues to spend $ 40 to $ 60 m every  day on power purchases , a well placed source informed us the dwr is  essentially bankrupt . it currently has no money for normal activities such  as ordering supplies , purchasing new equipment , etc . the department of  finance is forwarding dwr money from where ever it can ( parks , other  programs ) to purchase power , but dwr ' s hands are tied until revenue bonds are  issued . the california state treasurer phil angelides will be submitting a  recommendation on rate increases in order to secure revenue and cover $ 10  billion worth of state bonds .  davis & pg & e at odds  sources report that davis and pg & e negotiations are facing two difficult  challenges : 1 ) pg & e wants 2 . 9 times book , which is far more than consumer  groups recommend for the sale of its transmission lines ( sce accepted 2 . 3 ) ,  and 2 ) pg & e needs relief from davis for pg & es legal responsibility to be the  ultimate power purchaser for the state , and at this point davis wants to  limit further state energy power purchases ( especially for summer ) . the  utilities refuse to sign a deal which will leave them billions of dollars  further in the red ( $ 3 to $ 4 b ) and pg a measure that if accomplished would  provide davis with even less negotiating power .  with all this activity , davis is starting to lose support in the state  legislature . sources report increasing tension between the governor and  state senate president pro - tem john burton . burton has just announced a  special senate committee will investigate the generators for evidence of  price manipulation , and the state auditor is also planning an investigation .  davis increasingly realizes he has to protect any deal he signs against being  picked apart by the legislature and consumer groups later .  qf ' s most likely source of involuntary bankruptcy  sacramento insiders fear that a group of small generators will lose patience  and force bankruptcy on the utilities . sb 47 x may have been california ' s  qualified facilities last hope at avoiding an involuntary bankruptcy filing  against pg & e , socal ed , and sdg & e . the bill designed to cut the qf ' s costs  and provide them with a better rate structure is being held up in the state ' s  senate . sources indicate that a filing could come at anytime and further  investigations are underway to ferret out the most likely candidates .  out with hebert , in with wood  the bush administration favors replacing hebert , jr . with texas puc head pat  wood . there is an intense battle behind the scenes between senate republican  leader trent lott , who favors hebert , and president bush , who wants wood .  the administration would prefer wood because they do not want ferc to pick a  fight with davis which means bush might ultimately lose some western states  in 2004 . in effort to tone down the recent press reports , hebert has made  several token concessions to california , including $ 69 million worth of power  refunds and streamlining the federal permitting process for pipeline and  power plant installation .  it ' s is expected that ferc would most likely approve any transmission deal  that davis could complete but with a list of conditions . some conditions  might include bring the lines formally into the regional grid system as well  as other elements to pave the way for more dramatic administrative actions in  the west next year . the bush administration is opposed to price caps and  believes in free market solutions . the administration is also considering  whether it might be a good idea to privatize federally - owned assets such as  bpa .",not spam

"Subject: gas prices  vince -  1 . we can detect "" hoarding "" of pipeline capacity as an elevated basis against  the actual inflow .  2 . we can detect "" market power "" by dissociating the seller from the buyer ,  distinguishing between the physical "" cost "" in gas to run the generators and  the transmission cost in dollars , i . e . the basis .  3 . ( as you noted ) we can detect "" storage "" as the difference between inflow  and consumption .  it appears to me there are two time series needed for a straightforward model  of gas prices : flow rates at interconnects ( from telemetry ) and spot - market  prices . there is an elevated basis reflecting pipeline companies monopolizing  capacity , as well as hoarding of capacity by contracts . the dynamics of gas  prices reflect consumption demand changes due to changes in expectations for  the weather , as well as their impact on two highly strategic behaviors :  hoarding of pipeline capacity and storage of gas . we can "" calibrate "" the  price elasticity of demands for consumption and storage , and the price  elasticities of demand for transmission , as well as the extent of hoarding ,  from the two sets of numbers mentioned : flows and prices . what the basis  trader needs to understand are the incentives , and disincentives , for storage  and capacity - hoarding , in terms of the calibrated price - elasticities , and  each of these are as - if exotic call options at the consumption hub . finally ,  flows are "" explained "" by the model , and can be imputed from prices if  necessary , resulting in a purely stochastic model of the basis in terms of  the weather .  i believe the problem is quite tractable , and i would like to proceed with a  model .  clayton",not spam

"Subject: corrected : new update on ppi model for inflation book  dear all ,  i followed up on the suggestions at the conference call as follows : -  1 ) use less data  unfortunately , kicking out only 1990 makes the overall equation a lot less  robust , in fact dramatically so , and so eliminates the possibility of using  less data . the model tested was the rpi ( month + 15 ) ppi pre - empts the moves in rpi by about 8 months . the  magnitude of the oscillations is also reduced . this shows that if we had  more detail in our rpi forward curve , then the ppi model would reflect those  peaks and humps adequately .  conclusion  i therefore propose that we use the model that incorporates rpi , rpi [ t + 15 ]  and deviations of brent crude from long - term average . the new model is  plotted below in burgundy and can be compared to the old ppi which is  depicted in blue .  the new model achieves the two main objectives of the ppi curve : it is  significantly more robust and stable than the existing one , and it is  considerably less sensitive to the input coefficients , which results in us  having more confidence in our monthly p it was found that deviations of dated brent crude from the  long - term average of $ 18 . 80 was the best form of the variable to use ( for  predictions the brent forward curve produced by the global products group is  used ) . the three new equations developed were : -  pllu ( t ) = a . rpi ( t ) + b . rpi ( t + n ) + c .

( although it will probably be clear from our discussions the  model ( s ) we ? prefer ) . we therefore try and give ? as clear account as possible  of the advantage and disadvantages of all the ? models so that the reader can  make an informed choice as to the models which ? best suit their needs .  in order to meet our objectives the ? book is divided into 11 chapters . ? in  chapter 1 we give an overview of the fundamental principals needed to ?  model and  price energy derivatives which will underpin the remainder of the ? book . in  addition to introducing ? the techniques that underlie the black - scholes  modelling framework we outline ? the numerical techniques of trinomial trees  and  monte carlo simulation for ? derivative pricing , which are used throughout the  book .  in chapter 2 we discuss the ? analysis of spot energy prices . as ? well as  analysing empirical price movements we propose a number of processes ? that  can  be used to model the prices . ? we look at the well - know process of geometric  brownian motion as well as ? mean reversion , stochastic volatility and jump  processes , discussing each and ? showing how they can be simulated and their  parameters estimated .  chapter 3 , written by vince ? kaminski , grant masson and ronnie chahal of  enron  corp . , discusses volatility ? estimation in energy commodity markets . ? this  chapter builds on the previous one . it examines in detail the methods , ?  merits  and pitfalls of the volatility estimation process assuming different ? pricing  models introduced in chapter 2 . ? examples from crude , gas , and electricity  markets are used to illustrate ? the technical and interpretative aspects of  calculating volatility .  chapter 4 examines forward curves ? in the energy markets . although ? such  curves  are well understood and straight - forward in the most financial ? markets , the  difficulty of storage in many energy markets leads to less well ? defined  curves .  in this chapter we ? describe forward price bounds for energy prices and the  building of forward ? curves from market instruments . we ? outline the three  main  approaches which have been applied to building forward ? curves in energy  markets ; the arbitrage approach , the econometric approach , and ? deriving  analytical values by modelling underlying stochastic factors .  chapter 5 presents an overview of ? structures found in the energy derivative  markets and discusses their uses . examples of products analysed in this  chapter include a variety of swaps , caps , floors and collars , as well as  energy  swaptions , compound options , asian options , barrier options , lookback  options ,  and ladder options .  chapter 6 investigates single and ? multi - factor models of the energy spot  price  and the pricing of some standard ? energy derivatives . closed form ? solutions  for forward prices , forward volatilities , and european option prices ? both on  the spot and forwards are derived and presented for all the models in ? this  chapter including a three factor , stochastic convenience yield and interest  rate model .  chapter 7 shows how the prices of ? path dependent and american style options  can  be evaluated for the models in ? chapter 6 . simulation schemes are ? developed  for the evaluation of european style options and applied to a variety ? of  path  dependent options . in order ? to price options which incorporate early  exercise  opportunities , a trinomial ? tree scheme is developed . this tree ? is built to  be  consistent with the observed forward curve and can be used to ? price exotic  as  well as standard european and american style options .  chapter 8 describes a methodology ? for valuing energy options based on  modelling  the whole of the market observed ? forward curve . the approach results ? in a  multi - factor model that is able to realistically capture the evolution of a  wide range of energy forward curves . ? the user defined volatility structures  can be of an extremely general ? form . closed - form solutions are ? developed  for  pricing standard european options , and efficient monte carlo ? schemes are  presented for pricing exotic options . the chapter closes with a discussion of  the valuation of american style options .  chapter 9 focuses on the risk ? management of energy derivative positions . ?  in  this chapter we discuss the management of price risk for institutions ? that  trade options or other derivatives and who are then faced with the problem ?  of  managing the risk through time . ? we begin with delta hedging a portfolio  containing derivatives and look ? at extensions to gamma hedging ?  illustrating  the techniques using both spot and ? forward curve models . the general ? model  presented in chapter 8 is ideally suited to multi - factor hedging of a ?  portfolio  of energy derivatives and this is also discussed .  chapter 10 examines the key risk ? management concept of value at risk ( var )  applied to portfolios containing ? energy derivative products . after ?  discussing  the concept of the measure , we look at how the key inputs ?

placed sources in the government , the company has informed the  madhav godbole panel that it would be meeting on may 11 . earlier reports had  indicated that the discussions with the panel would take place on may 5 .  according to sources , enron would be meeting the panel with representatives  of its lenders and shareholders . the godbole committee , that studied the  current power purchase agreement , has called for cancellation of the present  tariff structure , renegotiation of the lng and shipping contract , removal of  dollar denomination as far as fixed charges of the tariff is concerned , debt  restructuring and the formation of a committee to renegotiate the power  purchase agreement . these suggestions , it seems , may not be acceptable to  enron . the maharashtra government accepted the report and asked the godbole  committee to renegotiate . the committee has been given a month  , s time to  renegotiate on behalf of the state government with dpc for a new ppa .  the committee has opined that since the lng facility of 5 mmpta is far in  excess of what is required by the plant ( only 2 . 1 mmpta of which 1 . 8 mmpta is  on take or pay ) , it should be separated into a distinct facility whose  capital costs should not be reflected in the fuel charge , not as take or pay .  it should instead be only in proportion to the fuel regassified for the power  generation . using the entire allocated gas requires an unusually high plf .  instead , the surplus gas can be sold to other players like petronet or enron  ,  s own metgas .  & it is important to distribute the cost over the entire  capacity and not just the amount sold to the power plant ,  8 says the  committee . similarly , it has been suggested that enron could lease out the  harbour facilities as a common facility to other lng importers . on the lng  contract negotiated by enron for long - term supplies , it has said that since  the lng market has witnessed great changes , particularly as far as prices are  concerned , the power company should take advantage of spot buys and  renegotiate the contract accordingly .  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  the times of india , friday , may 04 , 2001  enron ready to take part in ppa talk , nitin yeshwantrao  the enron management has finally agreed to participate in a ' discussion '  with the madhav godbole - led re - negotiation committee set - up to facilitate  the restructuring of the power purchase agreement ( ppa ) signed between the  us power major and the state government . officials of dabhol power company  ( dpc ) , a subsidiary of enron , alongwith their team of shareholders and  lenders will arrive here on may 11 for talks with the nine - member godbole  panel . though the dpc spokesperson was reluctant to give a confirmation , a key  mantralaya official told the times of india that the team had expressed  willingness for talks with the experts committee in a bid to end the  imbroglio .  enron ' s response is viewed as a welcome development to amicably resolve the  controversy which had been raging for the last few weeks , with the board of  directors of enron authorising its india md k wade cline to serve a  termination notice to mseb . the state government , on its part , too adopted a  confrontational position by slapping a rs 401 crore rebate charge on dpc for  defaulting on power supply . however , the sudden change of heart by the enron  management is largely attributed to the stand taken by its local lenders led  by industrial development bank of india ( idbi ) which had recently opposed the  move to pull out of the project . this was in contradiction to the stand taken  by the foreign lenders of the dpc who were in favour of slamming the brakes  on disbursement of funds to dpc . the congress - led democratic front government  had publicly declared that it would impress upon the enron management to  renegotiate the ppa as scrapping the project would not be in the interest of  both the parties .  last week , the state government constituted a nine - member panel of experts  under former bureaucrat madhav godbole . godbole had written to the dpc  management inviting it for talks to re - negotiate the ppa on may 5 . for the  delayed response from enron , the meeting has been rescheduled to may 11 . the  issues which would be debated at the meeting include the separation of the  lng facility from the power plant , renegotiating lng supply and shipping  agreements , redefining the dpc tariff and to convert it into a two - part  tariff . the godbole panel will bargain hard for removal of dollar  denomination in the fixed charge component and to allow the maharashtra  government to sell power to third parties .  - - - - -

arrival of its team from houston and other parts of the world .  however , the company has ultimately decided to meet the godbole committee on  may 11 .  dpc spokesman jimmy mogal said :  & we confirm that dpc has been invited to meet  the recently formed negotiating committee . as a matter of courtesy , we have  agreed to meet them next week . since the purpose of our meeting is to hear  out the committee and understand their thoughts , we will not present any  proposals .  8  & while we have constantly maintained that we are open to a  dialogue towards resolving issues , this meeting in no manner be construed as  an open offer from dpc to renegotiate the terms of the contract . furthermore ,  the published terms report do not represent an acceptable basis for further  discussions ,  8 he added . sources said enron corp chairman kenneth lay is likely  to meet former chief minister sharad pawar to find an acceptable solution  for the ongoing crisis before the may 11 meet . mr lay told the foreign news  agency on wednesday that the enron corp has no immediate plans to sell its  stake in the troubled $ 2 . 9 -
